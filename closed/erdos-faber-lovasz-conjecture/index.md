# Erdős–Faber–Lovász Conjecture

**Status:** Solved (2021)
**Solved by:** Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Daniela Kühn, Abhishek Methuku, and Deryk Osthus

## Problem Statement

If k complete graphs, each having exactly k vertices, have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one shared vertex, then the union of the graphs can be properly colored with k colors.

## Description

The conjecture was posed in 1972 by Paul Erdős, Vance Faber, and László Lovász. It addresses the chromatic number of the union of complete graphs that pairwise share at most one vertex.

More formally, if G₁, G₂, ..., Gₖ are k edge-disjoint complete graphs, each having exactly k vertices, and any two graphs share at most one vertex, then the chromatic number of their union is exactly k.

## Solution

The conjecture was proven asymptotically for large k in 2021 by Kang, Kelly, Kühn, Methuku, and Osthus. Their proof uses probabilistic methods and absorption techniques.

## Prize

Erdős offered $500 for a solution to this problem.
