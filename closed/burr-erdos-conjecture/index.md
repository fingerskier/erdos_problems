# Burr–Erdős Conjecture

**Status:** Solved (2017)
**Solved by:** Choongbum Lee

## Problem Statement

For every positive integer k, there exists a constant c(k) such that any graph G with degeneracy at most k has Ramsey number r(G) ≤ c(k)n, where n is the number of vertices in G.

## Description

The Burr–Erdős conjecture, posed by Stefan Burr and Paul Erdős in 1975, concerns Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs. A graph has degeneracy k if every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k.

The conjecture asserts that sparse graphs (bounded degeneracy) have Ramsey numbers that grow linearly with the number of vertices, rather than exponentially as in the general case.

## Solution

Choongbum Lee proved the conjecture in 2017 using probabilistic methods and a careful analysis of the embedding of sparse graphs into dense random-like graphs. The proof builds on earlier partial results by many researchers.

## Significance

This resolved one of the central conjectures in Ramsey theory and confirmed that sparsity fundamentally limits the growth of Ramsey numbers.

## Prize

Erdős offered $250 for a solution to this problem.
