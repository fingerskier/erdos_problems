# Erdős Distinct Distances Problem

**Status:** Solved (2010–2015)
**Solved by:** Larry Guth and Nets Hawk Katz

## Problem Statement

What is the minimum number of distinct distances determined by n points in the plane?

## Description

Posed by Paul Erdős in 1946, this problem asks for the minimum number of distinct distances among n points in the Euclidean plane. Erdős conjectured that the answer is on the order of n/√(log n).

A regular √n × √n grid achieves approximately n/√(log n) distinct distances, providing an upper bound. The challenge was to prove a matching lower bound.

## Solution

Larry Guth and Nets Hawk Katz proved in 2010 (published 2015) that any n points determine at least Ω(n/log n) distinct distances. This nearly matches the conjectured bound, differing only by a factor of √(log n).

Their revolutionary proof introduced the polynomial method to incidence geometry, using algebraic techniques including the polynomial ham sandwich theorem.

## Significance

The Guth-Katz solution opened new connections between combinatorial geometry and algebraic geometry, leading to solutions of many related problems.

## Prize

Erdős offered $500 for a solution to this problem.
