# Erdős Sumset Conjecture

**Status:** Solved (2019)
**Solved by:** Joel Moreira, Florian Richter, and Donald Robertson

## Problem Statement

If A is a set of natural numbers with positive upper density, then there exist infinite sets B and C such that B + C ⊆ A, where B + C = {b + c : b ∈ B, c ∈ C}.

## Description

The Erdős sumset conjecture addresses the structure of sets of positive density. It asserts that any "large" set of natural numbers (in the sense of having positive upper density) must contain a structured subset of the form B + C, where both B and C are infinite.

The upper density of a set A is defined as:
lim sup (n→∞) |A ∩ {1,2,...,n}| / n

## Solution

The conjecture was proved in 2019 by Moreira, Richter, and Robertson using ergodic theory methods. Their approach combined tools from ergodic Ramsey theory with careful combinatorial analysis.

## Related Results

This result connects to Szemerédi's theorem and other density results in additive combinatorics, demonstrating how density conditions force arithmetic structure.
