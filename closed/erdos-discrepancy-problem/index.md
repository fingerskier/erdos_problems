# Erdős Discrepancy Problem

**Status:** Solved (2015)
**Solved by:** Terence Tao

## Problem Statement

For any sequence of +1s and −1s, and any positive integer C, there exist positive integers d and n such that the sum of the first n terms of the subsequence consisting of every d-th term has absolute value greater than C.

## Description

The Erdős discrepancy problem asks whether, for any infinite ±1 sequence, the partial sums along homogeneous arithmetic progressions can be bounded. Erdős conjectured that they cannot be bounded, meaning for any constant C, one can always find a homogeneous arithmetic progression whose partial sums exceed C in absolute value.

## Solution

Terence Tao proved the conjecture in September 2015. His proof built upon polymath project results and used entropy decrement arguments combined with the theory of multiplicative functions.

## Prize

Erdős originally offered $500 for a solution to this problem.
