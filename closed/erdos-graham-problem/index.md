# Erdős–Graham Problem

**Status:** Solved (2003)
**Solved by:** Ernest S. Croot III

## Problem Statement

If the integers greater than 1 are partitioned into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets contains a finite subset S such that the sum of reciprocals 1/s over all s in S equals 1.

## Description

The Erdős–Graham problem, posed by Paul Erdős and Ronald Graham, is a result in combinatorial number theory about Egyptian fractions. It states that no matter how you color the integers ≥ 2 with finitely many colors, there will always be a monochromatic set whose reciprocals sum to exactly 1.

For example, {2, 3, 6} is such a set since 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1.

## Solution

Ernest Croot proved the conjecture in his 2000 PhD thesis, with the result published in 2003. His proof used analytic methods including careful estimates of exponential sums.

## Connection to Egyptian Fractions

This problem connects to the ancient Egyptian practice of representing fractions as sums of distinct unit fractions. The result shows that such representations are ubiquitous in any partition of the integers.
