# Erdős–Heilbronn Conjecture

**Status:** Solved (1994)
**Solved by:** Dias da Silva and Yahya Ould Hamidoune

## Problem Statement

If A is a non-empty subset of Z/pZ (integers modulo a prime p), then the number of distinct pairwise sums a + b where a, b ∈ A and a ≠ b is at least min(p, 2|A| − 3).

## Description

The Erdős–Heilbronn conjecture is a result in additive combinatorics. It was posed by Paul Erdős and Hans Heilbronn in 1964. The conjecture concerns the restricted sumset, where we only consider sums of distinct elements.

Unlike the unrestricted sumset (Cauchy-Davenport theorem), this result applies to sums where the two addends must be different.

## Solution

The conjecture was proven in 1994 by Dias da Silva and Hamidoune using linear algebra methods, specifically exterior algebra. Noga Alon, Melvyn B. Nathanson, and Imre Ruzsa later provided an alternative proof using the polynomial method.

## Significance

The proof techniques developed for this conjecture, particularly the polynomial method, have been influential in additive combinatorics and led to many further results.
