# Erdős–Ulam Problem

**Status:** Open

## Problem Statement

Is there a dense set of points in the plane with all pairwise distances rational?

A set is "dense" if its closure under the Euclidean topology is the entire plane.

## Description

The Erdős–Ulam problem asks whether the plane can contain a dense set S such that for any two points in S, the Euclidean distance between them is a rational number.

It is known that:
- The rational points Q × Q do not have this property (e.g., distance from (0,0) to (1,1) is √2)
- There exist infinite sets with all rational distances, but none known to be dense

## Known Results

- Ulam conjectured that no such dense set exists
- If such a set exists, it cannot be a subset of any algebraic curve
- Solymosi and de Zeeuw (2010) proved connections to elliptic curves
- Shaffaf and Tao (2018) showed such a set would have to be very "sparse" in a measure-theoretic sense

## Connection to Other Problems

This problem relates to questions about rational distance sets, the distribution of rational points on varieties, and the structure of the Euclidean plane.
