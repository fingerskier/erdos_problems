# Erdős–Hajnal Conjecture

**Status:** Open
**Prize:** $500

## Problem Statement

For every graph H, there exists a constant δ(H) > 0 such that every graph G on n vertices that does not contain H as an induced subgraph has either a clique or an independent set of size at least n^δ(H).

## Description

The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture, posed by Paul Erdős and András Hajnal in 1989, concerns Ramsey-type phenomena in graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs.

In a general graph on n vertices, one can only guarantee a clique or independent set of size logarithmic in n (by Ramsey theory). The conjecture asserts that forbidding any fixed induced subgraph dramatically improves this to a polynomial bound.

## Known Results

- Proven for some specific graphs H (paths, certain small graphs)
- A weaker bound of exp(c√(log n)) is known for all H (Erdős-Hajnal 1989)
- The conjecture is known to hold for all graphs H on at most 4 vertices
- Alon, Pach, and Solymosi proved it for graphs obtained by substitution

## Significance

This conjecture connects structural graph theory with Ramsey theory and has implications for computational complexity and algorithm design.
