# Erdős Conjecture on Arithmetic Progressions

**Status:** Open
**Prize:** $5,000

## Problem Statement

If A is a set of positive integers such that the sum of reciprocals 1/a over all a ∈ A diverges, then A contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

## Description

This is one of Erdős's most famous and highest-bounty conjectures. It generalizes the Green–Tao theorem (which proves that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions) and Szemerédi's theorem (which proves the same for sets of positive density).

The conjecture implies that any "large" set, in the sense of having a divergent reciprocal sum, must contain arithmetic progressions of any desired length.

## Known Results

- The primes have divergent reciprocal sum, and Green-Tao (2004) proved they contain arbitrarily long APs
- Sets of positive upper density contain arbitrarily long APs (Szemerédi's theorem)
- The conjecture remains open for general sets with divergent reciprocal sum

## Significance

This conjecture represents a deep connection between the density/sparseness of a set (measured by reciprocal sums) and its arithmetic structure. It would unify several major results in additive combinatorics if proven.
