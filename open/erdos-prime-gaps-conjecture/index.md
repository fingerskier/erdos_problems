# Erdős Conjecture on Prime Gaps

**Status:** Open
**Prize:** $10,000 (for the strong form)

## Problem Statement

Let p_n denote the n-th prime. The conjecture asks whether:

∑ (p_{n+1} - p_n)² / p_n

diverges.

## Description

This conjecture concerns the distribution of gaps between consecutive prime numbers. While the Prime Number Theorem tells us that the average gap between primes near x is approximately log(x), the actual gaps vary considerably.

Erdős offered $10,000 for a proof that the sum of squared gaps divided by the primes diverges, indicating that large gaps occur frequently enough to make this sum infinite.

## Known Results

- Cramér's conjecture suggests that p_{n+1} - p_n = O((log p_n)²)
- The largest known gaps are significantly smaller than Cramér's bound
- Zhang (2013) and subsequent Polymath work proved bounded gaps between primes
- Maynard-Tao showed gaps of size at most 246 occur infinitely often
