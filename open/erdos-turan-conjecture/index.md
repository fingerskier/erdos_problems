# Erdős–Turán Conjecture on Additive Bases

**Status:** Open
**Prize:** $3,000

## Problem Statement

If A is an additive basis of order 2 (meaning every sufficiently large integer is a sum of two elements from A), then the representation function r(n), which counts the number of ways to write n as a sum of two elements of A, cannot be bounded.

## Description

Let A be a set of non-negative integers such that every sufficiently large integer can be expressed as a sum of two elements from A. The representation function r(n) counts the number of such representations for each n.

The Erdős–Turán conjecture asserts that r(n) must be unbounded—that is, there cannot exist an additive basis of order 2 where every number has at most k representations for some fixed k.

## Known Results

- If r(n) = 1 for all n, the conjecture is trivially false, but it's known no such basis exists
- The conjecture is proven for certain special classes of bases
- Various upper and lower bounds on r(n) have been established
- Erdős and Fuchs proved that r(n) cannot be "too close" to constant

## Significance

This conjecture lies at the heart of additive number theory and concerns the fundamental limits of how "efficient" an additive basis can be.
