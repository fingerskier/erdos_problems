# Erdős–Mollin–Walsh Conjecture

**Status:** Open

## Problem Statement

There are no three consecutive powerful numbers. A powerful number is a positive integer m such that if a prime p divides m, then p² also divides m.

## Description

A powerful number (also called squareful number) is one where every prime factor appears with exponent at least 2. The first few powerful numbers are: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100, ...

The conjecture asserts that we can never find three consecutive integers n, n+1, n+2 that are all powerful.

## Known Results

- There are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers
- The smallest pair is (8, 9)
- Other pairs include (288, 289), (675, 676), etc.
- No triple of consecutive powerful numbers has been found despite extensive computation
- Erdős, Mollin, and Walsh showed that if such a triple exists, it must be extremely large

## Connection to Diophantine Equations

Finding three consecutive powerful numbers is equivalent to solving certain Diophantine equations. The conjecture is related to the abc conjecture and questions about perfect powers.
