# Erdős–Straus Conjecture

**Status:** Open

## Problem Statement

For every integer n ≥ 2, the fraction 4/n can be expressed as a sum of three positive unit fractions:

4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z

where x, y, and z are positive integers.

## Description

The Erdős–Straus conjecture, posed in 1948 by Paul Erdős and Ernst G. Straus, concerns Egyptian fractions—representations of rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions.

The conjecture has been verified computationally for all n up to very large values (exceeding 10^17). It is known that if the conjecture has any counterexamples, they must be prime numbers, as the conjecture can be proven for composite numbers assuming it holds for primes.

## Partial Results

- Verified for all n up to 10^17
- Known to hold for various arithmetic progressions of n
- If n ≡ 2 (mod 3), the conjecture holds
- Several parametric families of solutions are known

## Related Problems

This conjecture is part of a family of problems about representing fractions as sums of unit fractions. Similar conjectures exist for 5/n and other forms.
