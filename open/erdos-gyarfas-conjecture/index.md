# Erdős–Gyárfás Conjecture

**Status:** Open

## Problem Statement

Every graph with minimum degree at least 3 contains a simple cycle whose length is a power of 2.

## Description

The Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture, proposed by Paul Erdős and András Gyárfás, concerns the existence of cycles with special lengths in graphs. It asserts that if every vertex in a graph has at least 3 neighbors, then there must be a cycle of length 4, 8, 16, 32, or some other power of 2.

## Known Results

- The conjecture is verified for planar graphs (Heckman and Krakovski, 2013)
- Known to hold for graphs with sufficiently large minimum degree
- Verified for various special classes of graphs including claw-free graphs
- Daniel Král and others have proven it for graphs with minimum degree at least 3 and certain girth conditions

## Related Questions

More generally, for what sets S of positive integers is it true that every graph with minimum degree at least 3 contains a cycle whose length is in S? The powers of 2 form a very sparse set, making this conjecture particularly surprising if true.
